- **Voice Scam Detection**: Analyzes call recordings for fraud indicators with voice-focused AI processing
- **Video Analysis**: Identifies scam videos through comprehensive visual, audio, and text analysis
- **Text & WhatsApp Scam Check**: Detects phishing attempts and scam patterns in messages
- **3D Fraud Map**: Interactive visualization showing fraud hotspots across regions
- **Two-Step Verification Flow**: Safety verification and transaction confirmation screens
- **UPI Deep Linking**: Seamless redirection to payment apps (GPay, PhonePe, Paytm)
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Layered security with OTP, PIN, and biometric options
